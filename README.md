CSOrbits

This is an exercise prompted by a discussion about an old university project to create 2 circles in space and simulate the effects
of gravity on them.

The project creates a number of balls that excert gravitational force on each other. They also detect collisions and
rebound off of each other. The maths behind this turned out to be surprisingly complex.
