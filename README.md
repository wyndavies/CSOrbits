CSOrbits

This came about following a discussion about an old university project to create 2 circles in space and simulate the effects
of gravity on them.

I created code to do this and it was rather boring, so I added a lot more balls and then added collision detection and rebounds.

The maths behind this turned out to be surprisingly complex.
